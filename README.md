Testing the idea is quickly build something when ever i have enough time


TL;DR: Recommended Build Order
Git & Shell (repo hygiene, basic scripts)

Pick a Language (CLI tools, unit tests, small HTTP client)

Relational DB CRUD + REST (Bookstore API with Postgres)

Raw HTTP Webserver (learn raw sockets → minimal HTTP)

Dockerize (Dockerfile + docker-compose for API + DB)

Redis (add caching + Pub/Sub)

Kafka (order events, analytics consumer)

Microservices (split into API/Worker/Notifier, orchestrate with Docker Compose)

Adv Docker &&  Kubernetes (migrate your Compose setup → k8s manifests/Helm)

CI/CD, Monitoring, Security, Cloud (complete the end‐to‐end DevOps picture)
