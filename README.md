Testing the idea is quickly build something when ever i have enough time






# Topics Not Planned for the Current Sprint

## Networking Fundamentals
- TCP/IP basics, DNS, load balancers (e.g., HAProxy or NGINX)
- TLS/SSL handshake  

## Message Queues Beyond Kafka
- RabbitMQ (AMQP), Amazon SQS, SNS, or ActiveMQ  
- Compare trade‐offs  

## GraphQL
- Instead of REST, build a simple GraphQL API (e.g., using Apollo Server or Graphene)  
- Learn schema design, resolvers, and how to optimize N+1 query problems  

## Search Engines
- Spin up Elasticsearch/OpenSearch  
- Index your **Bookstore** data  
- Expose a search endpoint that allows filtering/sorting  
- Highlight results, aggregations  

## Testing & TDD
- Write integration tests (e.g., run your Dockerized stack in CI and run a suite of end‐to‐end tests)  
- API contract testing (e.g., using Postman/Newman or Karate DSL)  

## Message‐Driven Architectures
- Implement the Saga Pattern or Event Sourcing in your microservices  
- Especially useful for tracking every change in your **Bookstore**  

## Security / Auth
- Role‐based access control (RBAC)  
- OAuth2 flows, JWT blacklisting, refresh tokens  
- Secure microservices behind an API gateway  

## Serverless (if curious)
- Write a small AWS Lambda (or Azure Functions) version of your **order processor**  
- Connect it to a managed Kafka (or AWS MSK) topic  














# TL;DR: Recommended Build Order

1. **Git & Shell**  
   - Repo hygiene, basic scripts  

2. **Pick a Language**  
   - CLI tools, unit tests, small HTTP client  

3. **Relational DB CRUD + REST**  
   - Bookstore API with Postgres  

4. **Raw HTTP Webserver**  
   - Learn raw sockets → minimal HTTP  

5. **Dockerize**  
   - Dockerfile + docker-compose for API + DB  

6. **Redis**  
   - Add caching + Pub/Sub  

7. **Kafka**  
   - Order events, analytics consumer  

8. **Microservices**  
   - Split into API/Worker/Notifier  
   - Orchestrate with Docker Compose  

9. **Adv Docker && Kubernetes**  
   - Migrate your Compose setup → k8s manifests/Helm  

10. **CI/CD, Monitoring, Security, Cloud**  
    - Complete the end‐to‐end DevOps picture
